## Introduction

The overall objective of this project was to create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules that are covered during training. These core modules include: 

* Project Management 
* Python Fundamentals 
* Python Testing 
* Git 
* Basic Linux 
* Python Web Development 
* Continuous Integration 
* Cloud Fundamentals 
* Databases


As I had full control over the topic of this project, I decided to create a car hire system that would allow a user to select a car to rent from a list of available vehicles.
