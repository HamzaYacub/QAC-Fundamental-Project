## Introduction

The overall objective of this project was to create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules that are covered during training. These core modules include: 

* Project Management 
* Python Fundamentals 
* Python Testing 
* Git 
* Basic Linux 
* Python Web Development 
* Continuous Integration 
* Cloud Fundamentals 
* Databases


As I had full control over the topic of this project, I decided to create a car hire system that would allow a user to select a car to rent from a list of available vehicles.

## Project Tracking

A [Trello][trello-link] board was used to organise this project of all of its respective requirements and tasks.

![Trello sc][trello-sc-link]

## Diagrams

This was the initial design of the entity-relationship model which highlights the components and the relationships between the tables.

![ERD][erd-link]

However after careful consideration and a look at the requirements, it was clear that a customers table was not necessary and doing so could cause the risk of gold-plating which is mentioned later in the risk assessment.

![ERD2][erd2-link]

This updated ERD only shows the relationship between 2 tables rather than 3 as is mentioned in the brief.
